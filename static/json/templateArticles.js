        "articleTitle" : "A Natter with Brendan Owens at The Royal Observatory Greenwich",
        "articleContent": "Hidden in the heart of Greenwich Park lies the Royal Observatory Greenwich, home to the world’s 7th largest lens telescope, London’s only planetarium and Brendan Owens; a David Bowie fan, astronomer and public engagement manager at the Observatory. Brendan certainly believes this 342 year old site has some hidden gems to offer visitors that they wouldn’t experience when visiting other attractions. They have the chance to not only stand where some of the most famous figures in astronomy have stood but also to simultaneously be in the east and west of the world whilst taking in the most picturesque view in London. Founded initially to overcome sailor’s problems with navigating, the Royal Observatory created star maps to help them know how far east or west they were. This was not just a problem for local sailors, it was a problem for sailors all over the world. Therefore the position at which the telescope used to map stars from became known as the Greenwich Meridian Line, the 0 degrees latitude point on modern maps, creating a unified system of times zones as they travelled across the world. The observatory didn’t stop at star mapping, and other departments such as astrophotography and solar physics were formed over the centuries, culminating in work today being done on sun spots - areas much cooler than the sun’s core where storms are occurring at its surface. Brendan is currently involved with a project called the telescope appeal, looking to fundraise money for a new set of instruments to be used at the Altazimuth building. Dating back to 1899, the building is under used in terms of research, and the appeal hopes to transform it into an urban observatory, bringing real observing and active research to the observatory, putting it at the heart of future discovery. Although, there are still ways of reaching outer space currently at the observatory in the shape of the great equatorial telescope, situated in the green ‘onion’ dome. Sent to a safer place during world war two, the telescope has been used to view the moon, the andromeda galaxy and can be used by visitors to view Venus during the daytime providing a truly out of this world experience. The observatory holds a close place in Brendan’s heart having visited as a child with his uncle, poking his head through the gates, gazing at the incredible architecture and at the place where great discoveries were made. The Royal Observatory was home to all Astronomer Royals until 1972, including the likes of Edmond Halley who computed the orbit of Halley’s Comet and James Bradley who obtained proof that the earth orbits the sun; the telescope which he used to do so is still housed at the observatory. These discoveries were all made in amongst the beautiful architecture created by Sir Christopher Wren, from the Octagon room to Flamsteed house, a reason alone to warrant a visit to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Situated in a UNESCO world heritage site, the Royal Observatory is no stranger to famous people with Peter the Great visiting to have a drink with the astronomer royal at the time, causing havoc in the process. Whether it be Russian Tsars like Peter the Great, or space enthusiasts like Brendan, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich can offer a multitude of people an incredibly unique and epic experience in the city of dreams, London.
